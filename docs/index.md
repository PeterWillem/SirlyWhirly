Animus

*noun*

1. hostility or ill feeling.
    
    "the author's animus towards her"
    
2. motivation to do something.
    
    "the reformist animus came from within the Party"
    

Animus Worlds is an RPG engine for player-conflict driven stories: stories that take place in a world shaped by the motivations and conflicts between the player characters. The engine is intended for players who feel the urge to draw when they see a blank map, for players who like to think of answers when they hear a question, and most of all: for players who are excited to share this experience with the other players.

# Your help is needed!

Please help figure out the next steps for Animus Worlds by sharing your experiences. What felt intuitive, evocative or inspirational? What could use some more context the most? What flat out broke down when you used it? Your feedback would be much appreciated in the Itch forum of this game, or via feedback@dirlywhirly.com. Thank you, and enjoy this passion project.

# Background

Somehow, you ended up in a dream. All of you. Hints of the close-knit life you share pop in and out of your awareness. You need each other to make it through troubled times. But a burning question presses itself upon you:

Can you be what they need you to be?

Object of the Game

Dive into your dreams to find out if you are what they think you are.

‚ö†Ô∏è Safety warning: this game empowers players to share their own ideas in a way that can strongly affect you within the fiction. We highly recommend that you play with a supportive group that wants to collaborate, uplift and looks out for each other. Here are two tips to help you do so:
- Address each other by your character name within the fiction, and your real name outside of it. Do this often to always keep the distinction clear. When characters are devious, players stay courteous.  
- When you worry that content may come up that you are uncomfortable with, or when it actually does, flag it. All flagged content is blocked, skipped or undone, no questions asked.

# How to read this document

This document is written for both RPG players and RPG creators alike. More importantly, it removes the difference between the two. Players expand the game by playing it, and creators play the game to create their own. Players are creators.

The document starts with a section of important concepts. This shows all the ideas that went into creating this game. You can read these as a player to understand why the game does what it does, but you can also read it as a creator to understand how to make games like this one. 

Next, we have a set and a section about moves. These are things that happen in the story that triggers the game. They are created so in alignment with the principles of the game. The easiest way to understand them, is to use them. They are very open-ended, so it's hard to really understand how they are connected until you give them a go. Once you have read the principles however, you can already get a feeling of why the moves are there as you read them. Next we have spreads. Spreads give contacts contact to the moves. You might have heard of scenarios, or modules, or free written adventures, spreads are much like that. But in a way that also tells you how it will look on the table. The word spread is short for tablespread, if you place cards on your table according to the spread and then follow the rules of the moves and the rules of the tablespread, together they they create a more unique experience than when you just use the moves. Lastly we have collections. If spreads are ways to organize your session on the table, collections are ways to organize connected sessions outside of play. Actually, inside play as well... Collections is a word borrowed from bullets, is a flexible system that lets you organize your thoughts and analogue or digital form. Which collection is a way in which you can organize your thoughts, or in our case, our story. Because the game is so open-ended, we can't know what collection will be best for your story. But we can give you a system with which to make collections, we can give you a couple of common collections, like a world map or a relationship web, the community can then create more collections using the basic rules and their own imagination. You can even use collections from the fast bullet journaling community. That way, you can organize your story to your heart's content outside of role playing, using collections, and keep it simple with card spreads at the table. Together, they give you the power of a simple session and a vast world of interconnected sessions each card spread gives you a certain type of session. You could call this a game, just like incarnas is a game. But it's not a scenario yet, you still have the freedom to completely define the context of the story yourself. Lastly, we have the muses. Because this game allows players to fully control their story, we must always be careful around creative fatigue. Or even players not wanting to create all the time, and sometimes just want a bit of randomness. This is what the music are for. Whenever you ask the question you can let the music answer, instead of the players. There are universal muses, that are intended to be applicable to any context that you have within your story. In this way, if you would like to create a context, or scenario for your story, we would recommend that you create context specific users rather than pre-written adventure. We don't make stories, we make situations. The amuses the context specific music you create, are a great tool to suggest very specific situations. This is a lot like the old school dungeon crawling games that use a lot of dice rolling to determine what a dungeon looks like. Eat dungeon can have different random tables and even if the dungeon isn't fully fleshed out beforehand, the random tables already tell you what kind of scenario scenarios you are bound to encounter. So, that's it! The principles tell you what experience we are trying to create. The moves tell you how we create that experience. The spreads give this a structure within a session and the muses give context. So principles if reason, moves give, spreads give structure, and uses give context. Reasons, actions, structure context. It's all you need. The thing I am excited about, is that each of these is written with a method you can use. You can use the method behind the principles to create your own principles. You can use the template for a move to create your own moves. You can use the template for spread to create your own spreads. And you can use the template for muses to create your own users. That's the power of the creative kit. If you create your own game using the principles that we set out, you can just copy and paste the moves that we use. And you can add your own. But once you add something of your own, you will have to re-evaluate everything down the line. Because everything down the line is based on what came before. So if you create more music, you don't have to revaluate anything. But if you create new moves, you will have to re-event value weight your muses. If you create new principles you will have to re-evaluate the moves, and be evaluate the spreads and the users. To boil this down, it's easiest to hack this game lower down the hierarchy. How are you go with your hacking, the more you will have to reevaluate everything that comes after. Happy hacking.

The document starts with a section on the game‚Äôs principles. This section shows all the ideas that went into creating this game. You can read these principles as a player to help you understand the purpose of everything that follows after. You can also read it as a creator to understand how to make games like this one for yourself. 

Next, there‚Äôs a section about moves. These are the things that when they happen in your story, they will trigger game effects. Their purpose is to uphold the game‚Äôs principles during play. They are very open-ended, so it's hard to really understand how they do this and how they work together until you have given them a couple of tries.

From moves we go to spreads. Spreads is short for card spreads or table spreads. You lay out index cards on your play area based on the spread you picked, and this tells you a sequence of moves to trigger during your session. For example, in dungeoncrawling games, you could lay out the dungeon rooms with one card per room. You won‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in the rooms, but you do have a map of where you can go during your session.

The big brother of spreads is the next section: collections. If spreads are a way to organise your play session with cards, collections are ways to organize connected sessions in between. Think of world maps, relationship webs and quest logs. Collections is a word borrowed from bullet journaling, which is a flexible system for organising your thoughts in whatever way best suits those thoughts. Because Animus is so open-ended, it can't know what collection will be best for your story. Sometimes it‚Äôs good to draw a map. Sometimes it‚Äôs better not to. Instead of giving you one way to organise your story, you are introduced to a set of collections to choose from, and a way to use spreads and collections together effortlessly: spreads simplify sessions, collections connect them. 

Lastly, we have the muses. The muses offer context for your game. Whenever you have a question, and no player answers, you can always ask the muses by rolling some dice. Muses contain a lot of random inspiration which you can interpret as an answer to your question. 

So there you have it. Principles, moves, guidance, structure and context. Why must you act? What are you doing about it? When does the shit hit the fan? Where is the bigger picture? And who will you meet along the way?

One last thing, all five sections include a template that you can use to create your own principles, moves, spreads, collections and muses. Just remember that the design flows downwards through the sections: principles inform moves, and moves inform spreads, collections and muses. This means that you can modify or create spreads, collections and muses to your hearts content, but when you do so with moves and principles, consider how this might affect the later sections. Perhaps you make a move that could use a new muse for guidance. Or perhaps with this move a spread stops making sense and can give it an update. Happy hacking, and remember: players are creators, and creation is a part of play. 

# Principles

**Put your character on a balance between hopes and fears.**

Motivated characters have tangible hopes and fears that drive them. A taste of hell to move away from, and a taste of heaven to move towards. Give your characters one of each, and they‚Äôll always be motivated to act. 

**Opposing characters are the root of story. [add Neil Gaiman quote] One man‚Äôs meat is another man‚Äôs poison.**

When you give your characters opposing goals, story becomes inevitable. If you make your hope another character‚Äôs fear, and your fear yet another character‚Äôs hope, sit back and watch the drama unfold. 

**Balance between questions and answers**

Story is more than just blindly bobbing between hope and fear. There is tension, anticipation, climax and resolution. In short, there are questions that beg to be answered, and answers that more questions. Stories have an ebb and flow between questions and answers, as the characters‚Äô fate between hope and fear starts to twist, turn and crystallize. 

**Ask, say, roll**

It‚Äôs easy for others to feel like they don‚Äôt want to impose on your story, so it‚Äôs important to always keep inviting them. Anytime you have a question about your shared fiction, ask it to the other players, even if it‚Äôs about your character. If they don‚Äôt answer, say for yourself, and only if you don‚Äôt want to say, roll the dice and see what answer the muses give you. The more questions you ask, the more your world gets filled with ideas.

**Let the memes run wild**

No, not internet memes. The original meaning of the word is that in many ways, ideas are the new genes: we have  a drive to reproduce them, they mutate every time they do, and natural selection filters out the best ones. Drive. Mutation. Selection. What drives new ideas? Questions. What mutates them? Combining existing ideas. What selects them? Their impact on us (i.e. their fangs). So ask questions, combine existing ideas into answers and give them fangs.  

**Give your ideas fangs**

You make something happen. Other players like it, and wait to see how it will affect the story. Nothing happens. Now, you give the idea fangs, and it is about to bite the player to your left. They‚Äôll jump into the scene and deal with those fangs pronto! Make threats imminent and opportunities fleeting; give them fangs. It‚Äôs a simple trick, but hey, it works.

**I am because we are** Your identity is not created by yourself from nothing. Instead, you see how others see you, how you see others, and navigate the differences. To reflect this, there is no character creation. Instead, players give each other traits and navigate these. [Ubuntu]

- **Skipping stones.** To manifest goals, apply willpower rooted in truth.
- **Spark tables vs. encounter tables**
- **One spread of oracles for all.** Instead of having random tables to inspire one specific question, there is one spread with many oracles that you can access all at once. This allows you to answer any question that occurs during play using the same spread. To show the power of this approach, the book only uses those tables, through the use of oracle arrays.
- **Scenes, themes and tensions.**
- **Blank cards vs. filled cards.** All the basic cards ‚Äî goal cards, thruth cards and player cards ‚Äî can be used even when left blank. In this case, they are just used to signal what move is triggering, without write down any details that are not worth remembering.
- **Many roads to inspiration.** Inner. Pragmatic. Playful.
- **Memes.** To have a world unfold fully from a single seed, we borrow from evolution theory; all you need is a drive to reproduce, random mutations and natural selection. But instead of genes, we evolve memes: the *ideas* of our world. The story starts with 6 hard truths, and player characters that are each based on a desire to move those truths in opposing directions. In each scene, two truths clash to create new possible truths. Only one will survive, and their strength is determined by the amount of drama that went into it.

# Assign Traits

You are someone torn by a dramatic question: will you get to feel what you deeply desire, or become what you fear the most while trying? What that means for you personally isn‚Äôt something you control. It comes from the way other people see you and treat you. That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt create a character. Instead, you assign traits to the players around you.

State a truth that binds the players: ‚ÄúOur lives might change forever, because [a truth].‚Äù

Place each truth between two players. The truth to your left gives you hope. The truth to your right gives you fear.

 

<aside>
üí° For example: Luke fears the fact that ‚ÄúThe Empire is building a Death Star‚Äù, but gains hope from the fact that ‚ÄúThe rebels are liberating the galaxy from tyranny‚Äù.

</aside>

State a negative trait for the player to your left: ‚ÄúI think you know that you‚Äôre being [a flaw].‚Äù

State an emotional desire for the player to your right: ‚ÄúI think you need to feel [a desire].‚Äù

- Why don‚Äôt I have what I desire already?
- What makes me think I must be {my negative trait} in order to feel {my emotional desire}?
- Is me being {my negative trait} holding me back from helping {the player to my right}?
- How will our lives be changed, and how will we deal with it?

Play to find out what happens, and accept that you probably won‚Äôt find a satisfying answer to all your questions in just one session. 

<aside>
üí° Together you will journey through a world of your own psyches. By discovering and navigating it you will discover and navigate your own identity. The initial spark of a need and a trait is just the beginning.

</aside>

# Moves

- **First rule of moves:** don‚Äôt talk about moves. Each fictional move has a unique mechanical signal that tells the other players what move is being triggered. This makes mechanics fast and straightforward while allowing dialogue to remain firmly within the fiction. Players are incentivised to do so because the signals are required for receiving the mechanical benefits and connected fictional benefits. It does require all players to be aware of all moves and signals in advance. For this purpose, the basic list of moves is kept as conscise as possible. However, once all players are familiar with these, more could be introduced.

Moves occur when an event in your story triggers it, or when you signal other players that you want them to make the move trigger for you.

Triggers are directed towards the player to whom the trigger applies, but it is a shared responsibility to flag any trigger you recognise in the fiction.

<aside>
üí° When you explain this game to new players, walk through the trigger and signal of each move, explaining that they should perform the signal whenever they recognise a fictional event as a trigger for any player, or when they want to make a move themselves and would like the other players to think of a triggering event for them. A more experienced player can guide the group through the procedure of a move once it is flagged, so this does not need to be fully explained.

### Paint the Picture

‚ö†Ô∏è When you enter a new scene, or want a new scene to happen,

üö© Pick any two **truth cards** and place them together.

- State something new that you observe which reinforces or introduces a combining of the two themes. The more evocative and urgent, the better.
- Add urgency and **Ask a Burning Question**.
- If you don‚Äôt have any dice, take one.

Any other player that joins your scene may add their own observation to gain a dice if they have none.

*Example: you picked two truths: ‚ÄúDragon Warriors are applying scorched-earth tactics.‚Äù and ‚ÄúTea became our most precious commodity‚Äù. You then simply state: ‚ÄúOur family looks scared as our tea fields start burning.‚Äù Note the phrasing ‚Äústart burning‚Äù instead of ‚Äúburned down‚Äù to create urgency. You ask: will we be able to stop the flames from destroying our fields?‚Äù*

> ‚ÄúI have a pen,¬†I have¬†an apple. Uh! Apple-Pen!‚Äù ~ Pikotaro
> 

### **Ask a Burning Question**

‚ö†Ô∏è When you have a question, don't know what to do next, or want to be surprised, 

üö© Ask the group a question directly, or raise your hand first.

Each other player may answer. The more evocative and urgent this answer is, the better.

If no one answers, or you want more options, choose one:

- Answer the question yourself.

Choose the answer you prefer most. When you do, any player may challenge it.

- If a player challenges your preferred answer, and you want to pursue it, **Chase a Dream**.
- If no player challenges the answer, but something else in the fiction would and you want to pursue it, or if you just want to be challenged, **Create a Challenger** and **Commit to a Goal**.
- If no one challenges your preferred answer, and it is a significant detail to remember, **Establish a Truth**.

### Commit to a Goal

‚ö†Ô∏è When you commit to achieve a challenging goal, hope or dream, or when you want a new goal,

üö© Take a blank goal card.

Create a **goal** by stating it as a desired outcome and adding a question mark. 

- If your challenger simply wants you to fail at achieving your goal, add a question mark at the end.
- If your challenger wants a different, opposing goal, add a divider line and write this goal on the other side in the same way as yours.

<aside>
üí° Committing to a goal can take on many forms, as long as you feel like there is something you can do about it. It could be that you work to make something happen in the future: ‚ÄúI will manifest my truth: the empire will fall‚Äù. But it can also mean that you will search to find proof of something that happened in the past: ‚ÄúI will manifest my truth: my father survived.‚Äù

</aside>

### Take Action

SOFT MOVE

‚ö†Ô∏è When you take action to advance a goal or challenge another player, or when you do something risky, 

üö© place a die on the appropriate side of a goal card. 

If you don‚Äôt have a goal card to place dice on, place it on any side of the blank goal card.

Describe how the mood changes noticeably.

### Catch Your Dream

HARD MOVE

‚ö†Ô∏è When you and your challenger are done taking action towards your goal or you force the situation to resolve,

üö©pick up the dice from one side of the goal card.

An opposing player picks up the dice on the other side, and both players roll.

- The rule of 4: only 4-6 count as successes. The side with the most successes wins, and the opposing player receives all rolled dice for their player card. Resolve the goal accordingly.
- If there is a tie, half of the dice go to you, rounded down, and the rest goes to your challenger. You discover something that shows you your goal was misguided. **Ask a Question:** ‚ÄúWhat do I discover?‚Äù The Muse of Twists can help you find an answer.

### Concede **Your Dream**

‚ö†Ô∏è When you concede a goal or you concede challenging it,

üö© take any dice placed on either side of the dream card. 

The opposing side may achieve their goal and **Establish a Truth**.

### **Establish a Hard Truth**

‚ö†Ô∏è When you establish a significant truth, or something relevant that exists, 

üö© Tap a truth card. 

You may write the truth down as a fact on its own, or as part of another fact. 

### Ask an Oracle

‚ö†Ô∏è 

üö© Pick up the oracle dice.

## Custodian moves

Use and familiarise yourself with the previous moves as a group to unlock the following.

### **Sharpen a Hard Truth**

‚ö†Ô∏è When you‚Äôve learned new things that allow you to further specify an existing truth, 

üö© rephrase it. 

*For example, if you are domineering, and have since established that you are a ruler, you could sharpen ‚Äòdomineering‚Äô into ‚Äòtyrant‚Äô.*

### Create a Challenger

‚ö†Ô∏è When someone or something other than the players challenges you, and no players do, 

üö© Take a blank player card.

This player card represent the new challenger, or the group they belong to. A challenger can be a person, but also a force of nature like a wildfire. A challenger has the following mechanical traits:

- They have their own dice pool on their player card just like any player.
- After you **Take Action** to advance a goal they challenge, they will try to join the scene and **Take Action** against that goal.
    - Whenever the goal is advanced within the same scene again, roll all remaining dice on the challenger‚Äôs player card. If they roll one or more successes, they **Take Action** again ****to challenge the goal.
- During scenes, any player may represent a challenger.
- When all the goals that the challenger opposes are resolved, remove its player card from play.

<aside>
üí° If you feel like you would not challenge the preferred answer, but something else in the fiction would, you can consider creating an automa; a mini-player that acts on their own term. Keep challengers to a minimum to focus on interaction between the players.

</aside>

### Make Sense of Things

‚ö† When you try to make sense of all the questions, truths and goals floating around, or when they become too messy, migrate them.

üö© Raise your hand.

Explain what you would like to re-organise. It helps to identify linked truths and put them on an appropriate map, like a mind map, a relational map, a world map, or a side view map. Nested truths can be written as bulleted sub lists.

<aside>
üí° Example
Mike: ‚ÄúI know what you‚Äôre up to. It has to stop.‚Äù
Sarah: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt! While my blood is still pumping, I take a knife and I kill you‚Äù. 
Mike feels like Sarah skipped a beat there and places a die. He has none, so he takes one from the pool. ‚ÄúYes, I can see that you *want* to kill me, but before you do, I look at you with a cold hard stare that screams ‚Äòdon‚Äôt do this you fool!‚Äô, to wear you down.‚Äù 
Sarah places her own die. ‚ÄúTears do well up in my eyes, as memories flood in from our good days. But I shout through the tears: ‚ÄòIT IS TOO LATE‚Äô. And I thrust a knife to sink it into your heart.‚Äù 
Mike becomes sombre and lets a silence fall in the room while he considers the truth to these words. He takes all placed dice. ‚ÄúThe knife sinks into my heart. ...please hold me.‚Äù 

In this example, you see two players using moves without even talking about moves. They stay in the fiction and let the dice handle the rest. Mike and Sarah were interacting, when Sarah did something that Mike wanted a chance of preventing. By simply placing a die, he announced that he was making a soft move to prevent her hard move. He clearly stated what goal he was preventing (‚ÄùYou want to kill me‚Äù), and made his move. Sarah placed a die to announce her own soft move too. Then Mike took the dice to announce he was conceding, and did just that. 

Notice how no dice were ever rolled; they served merely as tokens that were traded, and the players were in full control of their fiction.

</aside>

## Creator moves

Use and familiarize yourself with the previous moves as a group to unlock the following. You will need to have read the sections on spreads, collections and muses to understand these moves.

### Chart a path

‚ö† When you feel the need to structure your session in a new way, 

give the new structure a name.

Workshop the spread with the other players.

### Reflect

‚ö† When you feel the need to organize your fiction in a different way,

think of a theme for a new  collection and name it. 

Workshop the structure of the collection with the other players.

Fill it in the context of your fiction.

‚ö† When a question occurs that could use a new muse, 

Reset the dice pools.

### Probe

give the muse a theme as a name.

Let each player paint the picture with a theme that fits within the theme until you have 6, and number them 1 to 6. 

This is a 1d6 muse, and should serve your purpose for the next couple of times. To move a 1d6 muse towards a 2d6 later on, take one of the sub-themes and repeat the process. Once you‚Äôve done that six times over time, you have yourself a 2d6 muse. All the included muses are 2d6 muses, but yours can be as large, small and asymmetrical as you want them to be. 

Want to create a 1d6 muse for which some answers are more likely than others? number them 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 6-7, 8-9,10-11 and 11-12. For such a muse, roll 2d6 and add the results. That way, the themes in the center of the muse are much more likely than the themes at the edges.

## Modes

- Guided
- Co-op
- Solo
- Creator

# Spreads

A spread lays out a path of tailored moves for you to follow, creating a guided experience. You can use it in a couple of ways. Choose a play mode:

- **Quick Play**, for when ****you want a fast, streamlined game.
    - Determine a starting player.
    - Pick a table spread and follow its turn order.
    - Don‚Äôt discuss your choices unless you want to **ask a question**.
- **Guided Play**, for when you want a guided experience with room to design your own story together.
    - Pick a table spread and follow the round order, but ignore the turn order.
    - Choices may be openly discussed and connected, and turns can be taken as you wish.
- **Free Play**, for when you want to just sit in your world and let it unfold at its own pace.
    - Ignore the spread altogether and only use the moves.

You can switch between modes in between play sessions to adjust the playstyle as you see fit.

<aside>
üí° In Open Play, truths and goals can quickly become too unwieldy to handle with a whole index card for each truth. Migrate your truths to other formats that better suit your current situation. Consider maps, charts, lists, etc.

</aside>

## Dream Catchers

Play proceeds in clockwise order, beginning with whichever player decides to **paint a picture** first. On your turn, you **paint a picture**, **ask a question** and **commit to a goal.** The player to your left is the **challenger** of your goal. You, your **challenger**, and any other player who joins the scene then **take action** as much as you are willing and able, after which you **resolve your goal**.

When you **paint a picture**, 

- Pick **truth cards** that are adjacent to each other and closest to you.
- Place the resulting **goal card** between the **truth cards** and further towards the centre of play.

## The Historians

Truth seekers

# Collections

**üöß COMING SOON üöß**

If spreads are how you organise a single session, collections are how you organise multiple connected sessions.

Collections are ways to organise your story beyond the spread of your current session. Because you are fully in control of your story, the game cannot predict what information will be important for you to organize, nor what‚Äôs the best way for you to do so. Instead, a simple and flexible system is used that works in both analogue and digital form.

üí° **Designer note**
This play kit uses the recipe approach, something I am prototyping alongside this game, inspired by a blogpost. The game's components are broken up into ingredients and a recipe. You can follow my recipe as the quickest route to my intended experience, but you can also create your own by using the provided ingredients. You can even throw the ingredients into your pre-existing game raw, adding dream sequences to your game in a way that follows from its existing fiction.

## Application to Existing Games

The Dream Catchers focuses heavily on character building as world building through a dream sequence. As such, at the end of a session, you will have charachters that are strongly tied to eachother and a world in which they play an active role. Why not use these as the start of a new adventure in an RPG you already know and love? Your next adventure starts when the characters wake up in a world that reflects their dream, armed with whatever insight they gained while asleep.
